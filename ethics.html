	Craig Coleman - Computer Ethics

In honor of Isaac Asimov I will begin my contract with the three rules of robotics:
1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

Narrative
I began using computers in 1982 and have always tried to be ethical and legal in use of computers.
Using Apple II computers I was able to copy software and modfied the 5.25 floppy drives so the speed could be changed to help with copying 5.25 
floppies.
In the early 1980’s software piracy was at it’s infancy.
I soon discovered it was not that difficult to use Open Source software solutions.

Computer Science  is important to modern society.
A Computer Scientist  must take care not to endanger the life, health, safety, and welfare of the public.
A Computer Scientist should demonstrate competence and due care in their technical duties.
A Computer Scientist must maintain and update their technical skills.
A Computer Scientist should avoid conflicts of interest.
A Computer Scientist should be honest and forthright in their dealings with others.
A Computer Scientist should be honest about their limitations, acknowledging errors and correcting them.
A Computer Scientist should refrain from discriminating against individuals based on race, religion, age, gender, or national origin.
A Computer Scientist should give proper credit to others for their work and honor property rights, including copyrights and intellectual property.
A Computer Scientist should help the public understand technology and support the professional development of peers.
